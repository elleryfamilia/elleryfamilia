# Hey, I’m Ellery 👋

I like building things — software, interfaces, systems, and occasionally odd little experiments that start as curiosity and turn into real projects.

By day, I lead engineering teams at **Volvo Cars**, working on the platform behind **volvocars.com**.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time exploring:

- AI systems that are useful *and* controllable  
- terminal-first interfaces  
- human-friendly computing  
- tinkering on hardware + software projects (often inspired by building alongside my kids)  
- tools that make building feel faster and more fun

## Open Source

### **Terminal MCP**
A terminal interface designed for collaborating with LLMs, with an emphasis on safety, control, and real developer workflows.

### **THICC**
A terminal-first editor built for speed, vibe, and modern AI driven development.

## What I’m drawn to

- AI that feels practical, not magical  
- simple tools with strong personality  
- interfaces that don’t get in the way  
- projects that are fun to ship and fun to use
